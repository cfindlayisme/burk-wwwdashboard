# Development paused/abandoned
No longer really working on this project anymore in 2022. Was fun, but is no longer needed

# Work in progress
So far this is just a hobby project to give me a way to read the meter data from a Burk Arc Touch Plus in a more analytical way.

It requires the other repository, burk-cronpull, to be dumping data into a firestore database first
